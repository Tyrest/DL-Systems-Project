Up until now, you have largely been using numpy for this purpose, but this homework will walk you through developing what amounts to your own (albeit much more limited) variant of numpy, which will support both CPU and GPU backends.  What's more, unlike numpy (and even variants like PyTorch), you won't simply call out to existing highly-optimized variants of matrix multiplication or other manipulation code, but actually write your own versions that are reasonably competitive will the highly optimized code backing these standard libraries (by some measure, i.e., \"only 2-3x slower\" ... which is a whole lot better than naive code that can easily be 100x slower).  This class will ultimately be integrated into `needle`, but for this assignment you can _only_ focus on the ndarray module, as this will be the only subject of the tests.\n","\n","**Note**: To avoid exhausting limited GPU resources in Colab, start by using CPU runtime for coding and testing non-GPU functions. Switch to GPU runtime when testing CUDA or GPU-accelerated code. This approach ensures efficient GPU usage and prevents running out of resources during critical tasks.\n"],"id":"b38216e2"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"db5a484c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763671846863,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":24896,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Zhang","userId":"07979726580656669632"}},"outputId":"57776a2c-ec8a-4e5c-ab22-c58735e15994"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n","/content/drive/MyDrive\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/10714\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/10714/DL-Systems-Project\n","Collecting git+https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git\n","  Cloning https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git to /tmp/pip-req-build-hkw5pm_y\n","  Running command git clone --filter=blob:none --quiet https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git /tmp/pip-req-build-hkw5pm_y\n","  Resolved https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git to commit ac73f725eb2ce0e2c6a38fa540035ee970b8b873\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","Building wheels for collected packages: mugrade\n","  Building wheel for mugrade (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for mugrade: filename=mugrade-1.3-py3-none-any.whl size=3708 sha256=a33cf60b74708d4bf626a403a5af050b7d7e702cb8762620cb13c530a348c2f0\n","  Stored in directory: /tmp/pip-ephem-wheel-cache-lezxcoyk/wheels/df/c7/14/2b747145fc762900af3ff05bd0c9192c506e70db3ef3890239\n","Successfully built mugrade\n","Installing collected packages: mugrade\n","Successfully installed mugrade-1.3\n","Collecting pybind11\n","  Downloading pybind11-3.0.1-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (10.0 kB)\n","Downloading pybind11-3.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (293 kB)\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m293.6/293.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m10.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: pybind11\n","Successfully installed pybind11-3.0.1\n"]}],"source":["# Code to set up the assignment\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/\n","!mkdir -p 10714\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/10714\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/10714/DL-Systems-Project\n","\n","!pip3 install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git\n","!pip3 install pybind11"],"id":"db5a484c"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!ls"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1833_Ylh_yss","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763671846962,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":96,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Zhang","userId":"07979726580656669632"}},"outputId":"2a60353b-4822-4d2c-ff76-946dfe205454"},"id":"1833_Ylh_yss","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["build\t\tMakefile\t   python     src\n","CMakeLists.txt\tproj_andrew.ipynb  README.md  tests\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"09eedbc6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763671887811,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":40847,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Zhang","userId":"07979726580656669632"}},"outputId":"ac9973fe-0eeb-4b5e-9fea-a2af40586720"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):\n","  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of\n","  CMake.\n","\n","  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.
